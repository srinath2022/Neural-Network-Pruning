# Using GAN to learn 'Good Pruning Masks'.  

## Part 1 - Create a pipeline to generate mask using standard methods and retain good masks.
Randomise existing pruning techniques a little to generate various masks for the same initialization and pruning ratio.

## Part 2 - Implement a GAN which could take in a given Network as parameter and generate probablistic mapping of channels for pruning.
